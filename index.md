Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying.

# Let's try this technique out. In the box below, insert the necessary number of spaces to make the poem render correctly:

We pictured the meek mild creatures where··  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,··  
Nor did it occur to one of us there··  
To doubt they were kneeling then.··

# In the box below, instead of using hard breaks, tighten the sub-paragraphs with soft breaks:

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.··  
   Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.··  
   If you do make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!··

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.··  
   Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!··
